**What is the type of the following expression?**

`3`
Ans: `int`

**What is the type of the following expression?**

`[1, 2]`
Ans: `list`

**What is the type of the following expression?**

`[1]`
Ans:`list`

**What is the type of the following expression?**

`[1,]`
Ans: `list`

**What is the type of the following expression?**

`(1, 2)`
Ans: `tuple`

**What is the type of the following expression?**

`(1)`
Ans: `int`

**What is the type of the following expression?**

`(1,)`
Ans: `tuple`

**What is the type of the following expression?**

`1,`
Ans: `tuple`

**What is the type of the following expression?**

`{}`
Ans: `dict`

**Note**: while `{}` creates an empty dictionary, to create an empty set in Python, you would use the `set()` function, as `{}` is not used for empty sets due to this syntactic ambiguity.

**What is the type of the following expression?**

`{1, 2}`
Ans: `set`

**Note:** A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It supports operations like union, intersection, and difference. Unlike lists or tuples, sets cannot have duplicate values.

**What is the type of the following expression?**

`[(1, 2), (3, 4)]`
Ans: `list of tuples`

**What is the type of the following expression?**

`(2, 3, 4)`
Ans: `tuple`

**What is the type of the following expression?**

`{"apples": 8, "oranges": 5, "bananas": 10}`
Ans: `dict`

**Note**: A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. In this case:
- `"apples"`, `"oranges"`, and `"bananas"` are the keys.
- `8`, `5`, and `10` are the corresponding values.

**What is the type of the following expression?**

`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][:-2]`
Ans:`list`

The expression `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][:-2]` involves slicing a list.

`[:-2]` is a slice operation that retrieves all elements from the beginning of the list up to, but not including, the second-to-last element.

So, the result of the expression `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][:-2]` is a new list: `[1, 2, 3]`.
