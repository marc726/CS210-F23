#### Command-line parameters

1. **Write a Python script that accepts two command-line parameters and prints their sum.**



2. **Modify the script to handle cases where the command-line parameters are not numbers.**


---

#### Functions

1. Define a function named `square` that takes a number as an argument and returns its square.


2. Write a function named `is_even` that checks if a given number is even and returns a boolean value.


3. Given the following code, predict the output:
```python
def g():
    x = 10
def f():
    x = 5
g()
print(x)
```

4. Consider the following function:
```python
def greet(name="Guest"):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

What will be the output of `greet()` and `greet("Alice")`?

#### Patterns

1. Write a program that outputs the following pattern:
```
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```


2. Modify the program to accept an integer $n$ as input and print the pattern of height $n$.


---

#### Multiple Return Values

1. Write a function named `min_max` that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns both the minimum and maximum values from the list.


2. How can you unpack the returned values from the `min_max` function into two separate variables?


---


#### Function Scopes

1. Explain the difference between local and global variables in the context of functions.


2. Given the following code, predict the output:
```python
y = 20
def example_function():
    y = 10
    print(y)
example_function()
print(y)
```

--- 

#### Challenge 

1. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string in reverse order.



2. Create a function that accepts a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.
